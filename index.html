         <h3>Our story:</h3>
         <P>Welcome to Hearth & Bean, a cozy, family-owned coffee shop where warmth and community come together over a great cup of coffee. Founded by two lifelong coffee lovers, we wanted to create a space that feels like home—whether you're stopping by for a morning pick-me-up, settling in with a book, or catching up with friends.

            We take pride in sourcing high-quality beans and crafting every drink with care. Our pastries are baked fresh daily, offering the perfect pairing for your favorite brew. At Hearth & Bean, you're not just a customer—you’re part of our family.
